# Book Directory

## Back End Application

## Purpose

I built this application to further my experience when working with Node.js. After completing a Udemy Course teaching vanilla JavaScript routes using Node.js I went ahead and built a book directory. This is a Back End Application and requires special technologies to use.

## About

This application was built using vanilla JavaScript, Node.js, UUID version 4, and Nodemon. While building it I used the MVC pattern (minus the View) to create the logic. This was great practice for me and I now have a deeper appreciation for Express which makes a developer's life a little bit easier.

## Usage

With this project being a Back End Application you'll need a third party application to use it properly. There are several different to choose from but I went with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). To properly use this application you will need to:

- download the source code onto your machine
- [download and setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywxIQ2ZXw4&t=44s) Postman
- start the server on your machine
  = using [GitBash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIbxvTsjqLw)
  - navigate to the projects root directory
  - run "npm i" to install dependencies
  - run "npm run dev" to start the server
- use Postman to perform CRUD operations
